# App Initializers
App Initializers provides a modular solution for performing initialization tasks that need to happen 
at application startup and/or when the app is brought to the foreground after being in the background. 
It is best suited for app initialization tasks that need to run on their own without user interaction. 
For example, loading some data from an API, or initializing a third party SDK. 
 In the future it may be possible to use Initializers to do work that does require usre interaction, 
like prommpting to enabe push notifications, or prompting to enable location services.
